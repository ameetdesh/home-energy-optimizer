"""The meter, given every device's power: the one place that knows the site's
electrical tree (types.SubMeter, GridConnection, SetLimit).

Every scorer (the coordinators' objectives, the saving split, the results)
goes through `site_meter`, so they all agree with each other and with the
Dantzig-Wolfe master, which models the same tree as LP rows. With no tree it
is exactly what it replaces: the inflexible load, minus the PV, plus every
device, then `apply_curtailment`.

The tree. The main meter (MAIN) and any further grid connection are roots,
each with its own tariff and limits. A sub-meter (a hybrid inverter, a panel,
a breaker) is a node with one parent - a root or another node - and its
connection to that parent has ratings and a conversion efficiency each way.
Devices and PV arrays sit on one node or root each.

Each slot, bottom-up, at each node:

* what its devices draw, minus its PV, minus what its child nodes send up,
  is what it needs from its parent (positive) or can send to it (negative);
* sending is capped at the connection's rating. PV beyond it is clipped, at
  no cost: the node's own PV first, then - if the site allows curtailment -
  PV further down, which a child then does not send. Anything the node
  still cannot send - a battery discharging into a full connection - is sent
  anyway and charged as a breach, at the grid's breach price;
* taking beyond the rating is likewise planned, and charged;
* its parent sees what is sent times eta_export, or what is taken divided by
  eta_import.

Then, at each root, curtailment for the meter's own reasons (an export cap, a
negative export price), from the PV on the root and from what the nodes below
can still give up; each kWh a node does not send is 1/eta_export kWh of PV at
that node. A set limit's breach is charged the same way.
