"""EMHASS adapter: coordinate EMHASS's devices as separate participants.

EMHASS calls `optimize` from `Optimization.perform_optimization` when its
`optimization_backend` is not "cvxpy". Each participant - by default one per
device - is answered by EMHASS's own model with only that participant's
devices enabled (`EmhassParticipant`): the price-response query is EMHASS's own
problem with no PV and no load, priced at the coordinator's price. Devices
assigned to "home_energy_optimizer" are planned by this package's solvers. The
plan comes back as EMHASS's own `opt_res` columns, plus `fed_*` columns,
including each player's share of the saving (`fed_share_*`).

`optimize` returns None, after logging why, whenever the configuration uses
something it cannot split per device yet; EMHASS then runs its default solver.

`site` is the house in one list: the main meter ("grid"), the nodes behind it
(an inverter, a panel, a breaker), limits on sets of devices, and the devices,
each with its parent, its solver, the group it is planned with and its
settings (`_site`):

    "optimization_backend": "dantzig_wolfe",
    "site": [
      {"id": "inverter", "parent": "grid", "type": "hybrid_inverter",
       "max_import": 4000, "max_export": 4000},
      {"id": "pv", "parent": "inverter"},
      {"id": "battery", "parent": "inverter"},
      {"id": "deferrable0", "parent": "grid", "group": "loads"},
      {"id": "deferrable1", "parent": "grid", "group": "loads"},
      {"id": "water_heater", "parent": "grid", "solver": "home_energy_optimizer", "config": {...}}
    ]

EMHASS works in W, this package in kW; EMHASS's P_batt is + when discharging,
the interface's plans are + when drawn from the meter.
